# Block ACK Mechanism (IEEE 802.11e and later)

The **Block Acknowledgment (Block ACK)** mechanism allows multiple data frames to be acknowledged **collectively** instead of individually, improving throughput and reducing overhead in high-speed WLANs.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Setup**: STA and AP exchange a **Block ACK agreement** via ADDBA (Add Block ACK) request/response.
2. **Data Transmission**: Sender transmits a **burst of data frames**.
3. **Block Ack Request**: Sender requests acknowledgment for the whole burst.
4. **Block ACK Response**: Receiver replies with a **bitmap** indicating received/missing frames.

## **Advantages**

- **Reduced Overhead**: One ACK for many frames vs. one ACK per frame.
- **Improved Throughput**: Ideal for high data rate applications like video streaming.
- **Better Channel Utilization**: Less contention on the medium due to fewer ACKs.
- **Supports QoS**: Integral to 802.11e enhancements for multimedia traffic.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Block ACK = Bulk acknowledgment** of multiple frames.
- Boosts performance in **dense networks** and **real-time traffic scenarios**.
- Enables **efficient frame retransmissions** using bitmap feedback.
