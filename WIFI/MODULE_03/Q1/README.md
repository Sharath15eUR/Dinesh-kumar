# Wi-Fi 802.11 PHY Layer Standards: Overview and Comparison

The IEEE 802.11 standard defines the Physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers for wireless local area networks (WLANs). Over time, several PHY layer standards have evolved, each with distinct characteristics that impact speed, frequency, and range. Here's a breakdown of the main ones:

## **Standards and Their Characteristics**

| Standard  | Frequency Band | Max Data Rate | Range (Approximate) | Notable Features                            |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 802.11a   | 5 GHz          | 54 Mbps       | Short (~35 meters)  | Higher speed, less interference at 5 GHz.  |
| 802.11b   | 2.4 GHz        | 11 Mbps       | Long (~100 meters)  | Affordable, wider range, but slower speeds.|
| 802.11g   | 2.4 GHz        | 54 Mbps       | Moderate (~50 meters)| Combines 802.11a speed with 802.11b range. |
| 802.11n   | 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz| 600 Mbps      | Long (~70 meters)   | MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) for high throughput. |
| 802.11ac  | 5 GHz          | 6.9 Gbps      | Moderate (~50 meters)| Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO), ideal for streaming. |
| 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)| 2.4 GHz & 5 GHz| 9.6 Gbps | Long (~80 meters)  | Improved efficiency, OFDMA for better sharing of frequencies. |

## **Key Comparisons**

1. **Speed**:
   - The data rate progresses significantly from 11 Mbps (802.11b) to 9.6 Gbps (802.11ax).
   - Modern standards like 802.11ac and 802.11ax are better suited for high-bandwidth tasks like HD streaming and large file transfers.

2. **Frequency Bands**:
   - Earlier standards (802.11b, 802.11g) operate at 2.4 GHz, offering better range but more susceptibility to interference (due to overlap with devices like microwaves).
   - Later standards (802.11a, 802.11ac) leverage the less crowded 5 GHz band for faster speeds.

3. **Range**:
   - Standards like 802.11b and 802.11n provide longer coverage, making them suitable for environments with large distances between devices.

4. **Special Features**:
   - Innovations like **MIMO** in 802.11n and **OFDMA** (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) in 802.11ax greatly enhance network efficiency and performance.
