# WIFI - OSI layers 

Wi-Fi primarily operates in the following OSI layers:

## **Physical Layer (Layer 1):**
- Handles radio frequency transmissions over the air.
- Manages data encoding, modulation, and transmission between devices.

## **Data Link Layer (Layer 2):**
- Incorporates the MAC (Media Access Control) sublayer for managing access to the shared medium.
- Handles framing, error detection, and retransmission of frames.
