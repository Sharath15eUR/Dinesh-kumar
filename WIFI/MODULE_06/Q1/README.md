# Pillars of Wi-Fi Security

Wi-Fi security is built on three essential pillars that ensure safe communication over wireless networks.

## **Pillars**

1. **Authentication**  
   Ensures that only authorized users and devices can access the network.  
   Common Methods:
   - WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise (802.1X-based)
   - Pre-Shared Key (PSK) in WPA2-Personal

2. **Encryption**  
   Protects the data transmitted over the air from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties.  
   Common Techniques:
   - AES encryption in WPA2/WPA3
   - TKIP in older WPA versions

3. **Integrity**  
   Guarantees that the transmitted data is not altered during transmission.  
   Mechanisms:
   - Message Integrity Check (MIC)
   - Cryptographic hash functions

## **Key Points**

- **Authentication** controls **who** connects to the network.
- **Encryption** and **Integrity** ensure **how securely** the data travels.
- All three pillars are critical to maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and trust in Wi-Fi communication.

## **Conclusion**

- Strong Wi-Fi security = **Authentication + Encryption + Integrity**.
- Modern protocols like WPA3 address all three pillars comprehensively to protect wireless networks.
