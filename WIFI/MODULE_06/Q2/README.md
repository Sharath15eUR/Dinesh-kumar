# Difference Between Authentication and Encryption in Wi-Fi Security

Authentication and encryption are two core processes in Wi-Fi security, each serving distinct purposes to ensure a secure wireless communication.

---

## **Authentication**

- **Purpose:**  
  Verifies the identity of devices or users attempting to connect to the Wi-Fi network.
  
- **Process:**  
  Ensures that only trusted clients are allowed access to the network.
  
- **Common Methods:**  
  - Open System Authentication (legacy)  
  - WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise using 802.1X and RADIUS servers  
  - WPA2-Personal with Pre-Shared Key (PSK)

---

## **Encryption**

- **Purpose:**  
  Protects the actual data transmitted between the client and the access point from being read or tampered with.

- **Process:**  
  Converts data into a coded format that unauthorized parties cannot interpret even if intercepted.

- **Common Techniques:**  
  - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in WPA2/WPA3  
  - Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) in older WPA

---

## **Key Points**

- **Authentication** is about verifying **who** is connecting.  
- **Encryption** is about protecting **what** is transmitted.  
- Both are essential for complete Wi-Fi security but operate at different stages.

---

## **Conclusion**

- A secure Wi-Fi network **first authenticates** the user and **then encrypts** the communication.
- Modern standards like WPA3 integrate strong authentication and encryption mechanisms together for maximum protection.
