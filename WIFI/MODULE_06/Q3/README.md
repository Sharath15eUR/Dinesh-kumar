# Difference Between WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3

These are successive Wi-Fi security protocols developed to protect wireless networks, each improving upon its predecessor.

---

## **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**

- **Introduced:** 1997 (original 802.11 standard)
- **Security Level:** Very weak  
- **Encryption Used:** RC4 stream cipher with 40/104-bit keys
- **Issues:**  
  - Vulnerable to key cracking within minutes  
  - Poor key management and reuse

---

## **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)**

- **Introduced:** 2003 (interim solution after WEP failure)
- **Security Level:** Improved but still vulnerable
- **Encryption Used:** TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)
- **Issues:**  
  - Designed as a patch to WEP  
  - Vulnerable to TKIP attacks

---

## **WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II)**

- **Introduced:** 2004
- **Security Level:** Strong (industry standard for many years)
- **Encryption Used:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Features:**  
  - Robust Security Network (RSN)  
  - Mandatory AES-based CCMP encryption
- **Issues:**  
  - Susceptible to KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) if improperly configured

---

## **WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access III)**

- **Introduced:** 2018
- **Security Level:** Very strong (current best practice)
- **Encryption Used:** AES with stronger 192-bit security in WPA3-Enterprise
- **Features:**  
  - SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) for better protection against brute-force attacks  
  - Forward secrecy  
  - Improved security even with weak passwords

---

## **Key Points**

- **WEP:** Basic, outdated, insecure.
- **WPA:** Quick fix for WEP, still weak.
- **WPA2:** Strong AES encryption, widely used.
- **WPA3:** Strongest, modern, future-proof standard.
