# Why Was WPA2 Introduced

WPA2 was introduced to address the security weaknesses found in WEP and WPA, offering a much stronger and standardized method for securing Wi-Fi networks.

## **Reasons for WPA2 Introduction**

1. **Overcome WPA Limitations**  
   - WPA was a temporary fix using TKIP, which still had vulnerabilities.
   - Needed a more permanent, robust solution aligned with IEEE 802.11i standard.

2. **Stronger Encryption**  
   - Introduced AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) instead of RC4/TKIP.
   - AES provides strong data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

3. **Mandatory Security Compliance**  
   - WPA2 made RSN (Robust Security Network) features mandatory for Wi-Fi Certified devices.

4. **Protect Against Emerging Threats**  
   - WPA2 addressed vulnerabilities like replay attacks and key reinstallation risks more effectively than WEP/WPA.

## **Key Points**

- WPA was a stopgap; WPA2 became the **full, standards-based security solution**.
- AES-based encryption in WPA2 is **vastly stronger** than TKIP or RC4.
- WPA2 adoption ensured **future scalability** and **enterprise-grade security**.

## **Conclusion**

- **WPA2 was introduced** to provide **strong, reliable, and scalable Wi-Fi security** by implementing AES encryption and fully complying with IEEE 802.11i standards.
- It became the **default security standard** for Wi-Fi for over a decade.
