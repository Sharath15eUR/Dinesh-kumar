# What Problem Does 802.1X Solve in a Network?

802.1X is a standard for **network access control** that solves the problem of **unauthorized access** to a network by providing an authentication mechanism.

---

## **Problems Solved by 802.1X**

1. **Unauthorized Network Access**  
   - Prevents unauthorized devices from accessing the network by requiring authentication before allowing connection.
   - Ensures only devices with valid credentials can connect to the network.

2. **Centralized Authentication**  
   - Uses a central **RADIUS server** to authenticate users or devices, providing more control over access to the network.
   - Centralized authentication simplifies management and enhances security.

3. **Network Security**  
   - Protects the network from security threats by ensuring that only authenticated devices can access network resources.
   - Reduces the risk of **man-in-the-middle** attacks, unauthorized data access, or network vulnerabilities.

4. **Per-User and Per-Device Access Control**  
   - Allows for specific access rights to be granted based on user or device identity.
   - Ensures that devices can be granted different levels of access based on authentication policies.

## **Key Points**

- **802.1X** provides **port-based network access control**.
- It solves the problem of **unauthorized access** by enforcing strong **authentication**.
- **RADIUS** servers are typically used to centralize authentication management.
