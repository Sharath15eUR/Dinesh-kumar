# Differences between 802.11a and 802.11b

| **Feature**        | **802.11a**                                  | **802.11b**                                  |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Frequency Band** | 5 GHz                                       | 2.4 GHz                                    |
| **Speed**         | Up to 54 Mbps                               | Up to 11 Mbps                              |
| **Range**         | Shorter due to higher frequency (indoor range ~35m) | Longer due to lower frequency (indoor range ~40m) |
| **Interference**  | Less interference (fewer devices on 5 GHz band) | More interference (shared with common devices like microwaves, Bluetooth, etc.) |
| **Adoption**      | Primarily used in business/enterprise environments | Widely adopted in home networks during early 2000s |

## Nutshell

- **802.11a** is faster but has a shorter range and operates in the less crowded 5 GHz band, making it ideal for high-speed, interference-free environments.

- **802.11b** has a slower speed but a longer range and operates in the widely used 2.4 GHz band, making it more suitable for basic home setups.
