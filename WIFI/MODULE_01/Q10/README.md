# Wi-Fi Topologies and Their Use Cases  

## **1. Infrastructure Mode**  
- **Description:** Devices communicate through a centralized Access Point (AP).  
- **Use Cases:** Home and office networks, public Wi-Fi hotspots.  

## **2. Ad Hoc Mode**  
- **Description:** Devices communicate directly with each other without an AP.  
- **Use Cases:** Temporary networks like file sharing between laptops or gaming setups.  

## **3. Mesh Topology**  
- **Description:** Multiple nodes (APs) work together to provide seamless and expanded coverage.  
- **Use Cases:** Large-scale deployments like campus networks, smart homes, and industrial setups.  

## **4. Wi-Fi Direct**  
- **Description:** A peer-to-peer connection without needing an AP, similar to Ad Hoc but with enhanced protocols.  
- **Use Cases:** File transfers, printing wirelessly, and streaming between devices.  

## **5. Repeater/Extender Mode**  
- **Description:** Extends the Wi-Fi coverage by retransmitting the signal.  
- **Use Cases:** Boosting signal in areas with poor Wi-Fi coverage.
