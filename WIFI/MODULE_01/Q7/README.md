# Configuring 2.4GHz and 5GHz

Due to a recent **OTA update**, my **Jio AirFiber Home Gateway** no longer allows **manual separation of 2.4GHz and 5GHz** bands. Both operate under a single SSID, preventing independent testing.  

## **General Steps for Separating Bands**  

1. **Login to Router:** Access the router's (gateway IP), enter admin credentials.  
2. **Go to Wireless Settings:** Navigate to **Network â†’ Wireless**. 

3. **Enable 2.4GHz Only:** Disable **5GHz**, save, and reboot.  
4. **Test 2.4GHz:** Connect a device, note speed, range, and latency.  

5. **Enable 5GHz Only:** Disable **2.4GHz**, save, and reboot.  
6. **Test 5GHz:** Connect a device, compare performance.  

7. **Conclusion:**  
   - **2.4GHz:** Better range, lower speed.  
   - **5GHz:** Higher speed, shorter range.  

Since band separation isn't possible on my router, I couldn't test independently.  
**Theoretically, 5GHz is faster but has less range than 2.4GHz.** ðŸš€
