## **Device-Specific Analysis**  

### **Realme 8 Phone**  
- Theoretical max speed of Wi-Fi 5 on 2x2 MIMO (80MHz bandwidth) is 867 Mbps (which aligns with your data).
- For a 1x1 MIMO device, the max speed would be 433 Mbps.
- Capable of operating on both **2.4GHz and 5GHz** bands with speeds up to **390 Mbps**.  
- Ideal for **high-speed internet usage** and **dual-band compatibility**.  
- Matches **Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)** based on its wireless standards.

### **Laptop (Linux)**  
- Supports **5GHz** band and a speed of **648.5 Mbps**, confirming **Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) compatibility**.  
- Chipset: **Intel Alder Lake-P CNVi Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 6E AX211 160MHz)**.  
- Since connected using Wi-Fi 5 mode (80MHz, 2x2 MIMO), the max speed would be 866.7 Mbps.
- The chipset supports **Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)**, but it connects to **Wi-Fi 5** due to router or connection settings.
