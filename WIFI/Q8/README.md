# Difference between IEEE and WFA  

| Aspect          | IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) | WFA (Wi-Fi Alliance) |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Purpose**   | Develops and publishes Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11 family). | Certifies Wi-Fi products for interoperability and compliance. |
| **Role**      | Focuses on technical standards and specifications. | Ensures devices from different manufacturers work seamlessly. |
| **Scope**     | Covers a broad range of technologies beyond Wi-Fi (e.g., Ethernet, Bluetooth). | Specializes exclusively in Wi-Fi technologies. |
| **Key Contribution** | Defines technical guidelines for wireless communication protocols. | Provides Wi-Fi CERTIFIEDâ„¢ branding for compliant products. |

## Nutshell

- **IEEE** is responsible for creating and defining Wi-Fi standards (e.g., 802.11 family).  

- **WFA** ensures that products based on these standards are interoperable and meet user expectations.
