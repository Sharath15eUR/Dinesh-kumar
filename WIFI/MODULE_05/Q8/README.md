# Purpose of 802.11k and 802.11v and their Aid in Roaming

The **802.11k** and **802.11v** are amendments to the Wi-Fi standard that focus on improving **roaming** between access points (APs) and **network management**. Together, they enhance the **handover process** and **overall network performance** in environments with multiple APs.

## **802.11k – Radio Resource Management (RRM)**

### **Purpose**
- 802.11k focuses on **radio resource management (RRM)**, which helps devices make more informed decisions about which AP to connect to during roaming.
- It allows clients to collect **neighbor AP information** and optimize their connection to improve performance.

### **How It Aids in Roaming**
1. **Neighbor Report**  
   - Devices can request and receive information about nearby APs (e.g., signal strength, channel usage).
   - This allows the device to choose an AP with the **best signal quality** when roaming, reducing **handover time** and avoiding unnecessary disconnections.

2. **Improved Handover**  
   - When moving between APs, the client can use the data from 802.11k to select an AP with **better coverage**, ensuring a smoother and faster handoff.

## **802.11v – Wireless Network Management**

### **Purpose**
- 802.11v provides **network management features** to improve client interactions with the network.
- It allows the AP to inform clients of network changes and assists in **client power management**.

### **How It Aids in Roaming**
1. **BSS Transition Management**  
   - 802.11v enables APs to communicate with devices, providing them with information about **optimal APs** to roam to within the network.
   - It **coordinates handoffs**, reducing the chances of dropping connections during roaming.

2. **Load Balancing**  
   - The AP can instruct a client to move to a different AP if the current one is congested or overloaded, improving overall network performance and ensuring efficient use of resources.

3. **Power Save Mode Coordination**  
   - 802.11v helps clients manage their **power consumption** while roaming by optimizing when and how often the client listens for APs.

---

## **Key Points**

- **802.11k**: Enhances roaming by providing **neighbor AP information**, allowing devices to select the best AP for seamless handover.
- **802.11v**: Improves roaming by allowing **AP-to-client communication**, enabling **load balancing**, and ensuring better **power management** during transitions.
- Both standards work together to ensure **smoother roaming**, **faster handoffs**, and more **efficient use of network resources**.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **802.11k** and **802.11v** play a critical role in **optimizing roaming** between access points, providing improved **network efficiency**, faster handoffs, and enhanced user experience in environments with multiple APs.
