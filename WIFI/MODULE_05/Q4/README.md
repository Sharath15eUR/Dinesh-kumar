# Difference Between Authentication and Encryption in Wi-Fi Security

## Authentication
- **Purpose:** Confirms the identity of devices and users before granting access to the network.
- **Function:** Ensures that only authorized users can connect.
- **Example:** WPA2-Enterprise uses EAP methods for authenticating users against a server.

## Encryption
- **Purpose:** Protects the data transmitted over Wi-Fi from being read by unauthorized parties.
- **Function:** Scrambles the data so that even if intercepted, it cannot be understood.
- **Example:** WPA3 uses AES encryption to secure communication between devices.

## Summary
- **Authentication** deals with **who** can connect.  
- **Encryption** deals with **protecting** the data **after connection**.
