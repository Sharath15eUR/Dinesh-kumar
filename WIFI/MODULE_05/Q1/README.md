# Wi-Fi 5, 6, 6E, and 7

## Key Features

### Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac)

- **Frequency**: 5 GHz band only  
- **Channel Width**: Up to 160 MHz for faster data transfer  
- **Speed**: Up to 6.9 Gbps (theoretical)  
- **MU-MIMO**: Supports up to 4 devices simultaneously  
- **Key Limitation**: No efficient data sharing in crowded networks, leading to congestion in busy areas like offices or apartments

### Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax)

- **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands  
- **Channel Width**: Up to 160 MHz  
- **Speed**: Up to 9.6 Gbps (theoretical)  
- **OFDMA**: Splits channels among devices to reduce wait times  
- **MU-MIMO**: Supports up to 8 devices  
- **Target Wake Time (TWT)**: Devices sleep when not in use, saving battery  
- **Difference from Wi-Fi 5**: Faster, handles more devices efficiently, and reduces power consumption — ideal for smart homes

### Wi-Fi 6E

- **Frequency**: Adds 6 GHz band to existing 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz  
- **Channel Width**: Up to 160 MHz  
- **Speed**: Similar to Wi-Fi 6, but faster in practice due to reduced interference  
- **Key Benefit**: 6 GHz offers more channels with less congestion, resulting in lower latency and smoother connections  
- **Difference from Wi-Fi 5/6**: Requires Wi-Fi 6E-compatible devices but significantly boosts performance in high-demand environments

### Wi-Fi 7 (802.11be)

- **Frequency**: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands  
- **Channel Width**: Up to 320 MHz (double that of Wi-Fi 6/6E)  
- **Speed**: Up to 46 Gbps (theoretical)  
- **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**: Uses multiple bands simultaneously for better performance  
- **4096 QAM**: Packs more data per transmission, increasing throughput  
- **MU-MIMO**: Supports up to 16 devices  
- **Difference from Wi-Fi 5/6/6E**: Huge boost in speed, capacity, and efficiency — future-ready for VR, 8K streaming, and smart automation
