## **WiFi 7 (802.11be)**

### **Key Features**
- **Multi-Link Operation (MLO)**: Allows devices to connect simultaneously on multiple channels (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz), **improving throughput** and **reducing latency**.
- **4096-QAM**: Improves **data rates** even further by increasing the modulation from **1024-QAM** (WiFi 6) to **4096-QAM**, enabling **higher throughput**.
- **Wider Channels (320 MHz)**: WiFi 7 supports **320 MHz** channels, doubling the bandwidth compared to **WiFi 6**â€™s **160 MHz** channels.
- **Faster Speeds and Lower Latency**: WiFi 7 is designed to support **multi-gigabit speeds** with **reduced latency**, ideal for real-time applications like **gaming** and **high-definition video conferencing**.
- **Enhanced Channel Access (EHT)**: Optimizes how devices access the wireless medium, improving overall **efficiency** and **throughput**.

### **Differences from WiFi 6 and 6E**
- **WiFi 7** introduces **multi-link operation (MLO)**, allowing devices to transmit on multiple bands simultaneously, significantly **boosting throughput** and **reducing congestion** compared to **WiFi 6** and **WiFi 6E**.
- **WiFi 7** uses **4096-QAM** and **320 MHz channels**, providing **higher speeds** and **better efficiency** than **WiFi 6** (which uses **1024-QAM** and **160 MHz channels**).
- **WiFi 7** also **lowers latency** and supports **more devices** in **high-density** environments, outperforming **WiFi 6** in scenarios requiring **high-speed** and **low-latency** performance, like **AR/VR** or **4K/8K streaming**.
