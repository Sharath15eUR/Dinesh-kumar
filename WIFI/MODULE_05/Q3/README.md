# Pillars of Wi-Fi Security

Wi-Fi security stands on three fundamental pillars:

## 1. Authentication
- Verifies that only authorized users and devices can access the network.
- **Example:** WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise use 802.1X for secure authentication.

## 2. Encryption
- Secures data by encoding it to prevent unauthorized access during transmission.
- **Example:** WPA3 employs AES encryption for stronger protection.

## 3. Integrity
- Ensures that data is not altered or tampered with during transmission.
- **Example:** Message Integrity Check (MIC) is used to detect packet modifications.
