# SplitMAC Architecture: Overview and Performance Benefits

## **What is SplitMAC Architecture?**
SplitMAC architecture is a network design approach where the functionality of the MAC (Medium Access Control) layer in Wi-Fi communication is divided between two entities:
1. **Access Point (AP):** Handles real-time functions at the edge of the network.
2. **Centralized Controller:** Takes care of non-real-time, higher-level management tasks.

This separation allows each component to focus on its strengths, resulting in better network performance and scalability.

## **How SplitMAC Improves AP Performance**

### **1. Offloading Non-Critical Tasks**
   - Non-time-sensitive MAC layer functions like security management, association, and handoffs are handled by the central controller.
   - The AP is left with time-critical tasks (e.g., frame queuing, packet scheduling), improving its processing efficiency.

### **2. Simplified Access Points**
   - APs in a SplitMAC setup are lightweight and less complex (also known as "thin APs").
   - This reduces the cost of deployment and maintenance, as the bulk of the intelligence resides in the controller.

### **3. Better Scalability**
   - The centralized controller manages resource-intensive tasks for multiple APs, enabling easy scaling of the network by adding more thin APs without significant overhead.

### **4. Enhanced Network Management**
   - Centralized control allows for seamless monitoring, configuration, and optimization of all APs from a single location.
   - Features like load balancing, RF management, and policy enforcement are handled efficiently.

### **5. Improved Roaming**
   - With the controller managing client associations, handoffs between APs are seamless and faster, enhancing the experience for mobile users.

## **Conclusion**

SplitMAC architecture divides responsibilities between APs and controllers, streamlining operations and reducing the burden on individual APs. This design leads to cost efficiency, better scalability, improved roaming, and enhanced overall network performance. It is particularly well-suited for enterprise Wi-Fi deployments.
