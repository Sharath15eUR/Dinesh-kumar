# Challenges of Deploying Autonomous APs in Large Networks

Deploying over 50 autonomous access points (APs) in a large network such as a university setting presents several challenges. Unlike lightweight or cloud-managed APs, autonomous APs operate independently without centralized coordination, which can lead to inefficiencies and complexity.

## **Key Challenges**

### **1. Lack of Centralized Management**
   - Each AP requires individual configuration and monitoring.
   - Updates, security patches, and settings need to be applied manually to each AP.
   - **Impact**:
     - Increased administrative workload.
     - Higher chances of inconsistent configurations across APs.

### **2. Scalability Issues**
   - As the number of APs grows, manual management becomes cumbersome.
   - Adding new APs requires reconfiguration of the existing network to avoid conflicts.
   - **Impact**:
     - Difficult to maintain seamless connectivity for users as the network grows.

### **3. RF (Radio Frequency) Management**
   - Autonomous APs do not coordinate with each other for channel selection or power levels.
   - This can lead to **channel overlap** and **co-channel interference**, degrading network performance.
   - **Impact**:
     - Reduced throughput and connectivity issues, especially in high-density environments.

### **4. Security Risks**
   - Autonomous APs lack centralized monitoring for detecting rogue APs or malicious activity.
   - Updates and patches may not be applied uniformly, leaving security gaps.
   - **Impact**:
     - Increased vulnerability to attacks like unauthorized access or eavesdropping.

### **5. Roaming Challenges**
   - Autonomous APs cannot manage seamless client roaming between APs.
   - Clients may experience frequent disconnections or delays when moving across campus.
   - **Impact**:
     - Poor user experience for mobile students and staff.

### **6. Network Performance Monitoring**
   - Without a centralized controller, monitoring network performance (e.g., traffic analysis, usage patterns) across all APs becomes difficult.
   - Troubleshooting network issues requires accessing each AP individually.
   - **Impact**:
     - Slower identification and resolution of network problems.

### **7. Deployment Complexity**
   - Planning for more than 50 APs requires careful consideration of:
     - IP addressing.
     - SSID assignments.
     - Load balancing.
   - Autonomous APs do not offer dynamic adjustments, increasing deployment complexity.
   - **Impact**:
     - Time-consuming deployment process.

## **Use Case Considerations**
- Autonomous APs are better suited for small-scale networks with minimal administrative overhead.
- Large-scale networks like universities typically benefit from **lightweight APs with centralized controllers** or **cloud-managed APs** for efficient management and scalability.

## **Conclusion**

Deploying a large number of autonomous APs in a university network poses challenges related to scalability, security, and performance management. A centralized solution—such as lightweight APs or cloud-managed systems—is often more effective for handling large networks while simplifying administration and enhancing user experience.
