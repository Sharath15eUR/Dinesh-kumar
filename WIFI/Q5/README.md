# Bridge Mode vs. Repeater Mode  

| Aspect            | Bridge Mode                                     | Repeater Mode                               |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Purpose**      | Connects two different networks and extends coverage | Expands Wi-Fi coverage by amplifying signals |
| **Functionality** | Allows devices in separate networks to communicate | Rebroadcasts Wi-Fi signals from the main network |
| **IP Addressing** | Devices get IP addresses from their respective networks | All devices use the same IP addressing scheme |
| **Use Case**      | Useful for connecting wired and wireless networks | Ideal for extending Wi-Fi in areas with poor signal |
| **Performance Impact** | Minimal, as it avoids re-amplifying signals | Reduced speed, as signals are retransmitted |
