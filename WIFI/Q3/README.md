# BSS and ESS

## **Basic Service Set (BSS):**
- Represents the fundamental building block of a Wi-Fi network.
- Consists of a single access point (AP) and the devices connected to it.
- Identified by a unique Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID), typically the MAC address of the access point.

## **Extended Service Set (ESS):**
- A collection of multiple Basic Service Sets (BSSs) that are connected via a common distribution system (e.g., Ethernet).
- Allows seamless roaming for devices between different BSSs within the same network.
- Identified by a shared SSID (Service Set Identifier).
