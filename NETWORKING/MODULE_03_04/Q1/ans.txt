WORKFLOW:

1. A small network consisting of 1 switch and 3 PC's (devices) had been simulated using Cisco Packet Tracer

2. IP's are statically configured for each PC.

3. After setting these IP's are viewed by 'ipconfig /all' command (since simulated PC's use a simple OS). Also MAC address can be viewed

4. Initially on entering 'arp', no entries are found.

5. After seriess of pinging, arp is obtained with a cache out time line 100s, 110s.

6. Finally MAC address of switch is obtained using show 'mac address-table' command

7. Wireshark can be integrated wrt GNS3. Whereas in Packet tracer inbuilt packet capture is present, which can be used to view the ethernet frames and MAC addressing of src and destination
