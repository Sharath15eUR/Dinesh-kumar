WORKFLOW: (same stuffs in previous questiion hav been performed but using GNS3 & Wireshark)

1. A network is simulated using using GNS3 

2. Traffic is created using 'ping'ing

3. There would be a initial ARP broadcast message that contains source and dest addresses, payload, FCS 

4. And further ICMP msgs are used to check connectivity which goes from src to dest (no broadcast) as arp table knows who's (MAC address) the given ip

5. These are analyzed using Wireshark
