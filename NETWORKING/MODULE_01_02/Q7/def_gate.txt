What is a Default Gateway?
A default gateway is a network device, typically a router, that acts as an access point or IP router that a computer uses to send information to another network or the internet. When a device wants to communicate with a device outside its local network, it sends the data to the default gateway, which then forwards it to the appropriate destination.
